### This is the repository for "Machine Learning for Intelligent Character Recognition"

Please note that the folder "Kaggle codes" were run on kaggle and downloaded as a notebook with its output.\
"ICR program" was ran using Visual Studio Code.\
"ICR Examples" are the testing images used in open-source solution survey and ICR program testing.\
The paths of the files for dataset, testing images for prediction, and model imports must be modified accordingly.\
For each set of code the libraries stated at the beginning must be imported correctly.\
The tesseract code needed some 'pip install' lines for certain libraries.\
Please ignore the "gitattributes" and ".DS_Store" files as they were only used to allow the upload of large files to github repository.
